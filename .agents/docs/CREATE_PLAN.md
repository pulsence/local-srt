# Creating a Task Plan

This document defines how to create task plans for Local Second Mind feature development.

## Task Plan Structure

Every task plan should be broken down into **numbered task phases**. These phases are major feature implementations which are numbered:

```
## Phase N: Major Feature Name
```

### Task Blocks

Each phase is broken into task blocks with a descriptive title:

```
### N.N: Feature Description
```

Each task block can be broken into smaller sub-blocks:

```
#### N.N.N: Sub Feature Description
```

## Task Block Contents

Each task block must contain:
1. A list of tasks to complete
2. A short description of the feature
3. The files to modify or create

## Post-Task Completion

After completing a task block, the following must be done:

1. Create/update tests for new features
3. Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v`
4. Update `USER_GUIDE.md` to reflect the changes to the code base.
5. Update Architecture and Key Files sections in .agents/docs/ as needed
6. Run `git add` on all modified files and `git commit` with a message following the format in `COMMIT_MESSAGE.md` (see [COMMIT_MESSAGE.md](./COMMIT_MESSAGE.md))

## Success Criteria

Each task block must have a `**success criteria:**` which clearly describes what a successful implementation results in.

## Code Review Phase

Every Major Feature phase should have a final code review phase with tasks:
- Review the changes and ensure the phase is entirely implemented
- Review code for backwards compatibility, deprecated code, or dead code
- Review tests to ensure they are well-structured with no mocks or stubs

## Changelog

Every Major Feature phase should end with a task summarizing the changes and writing them into `CHANGELOG.md`.
